The python-boss-skynet package provides the SkyNET controller that is
managed by daemontools.

The sample ParticipantHandler can be installed into skynet:
  make_skynet_participant -n example -p /usr/share/doc/python-boss-skynet/example-participant

Then it can be enabled (ie starts/stops automatically):
  skynet enable example

To monitor the log output:
  skynet log example

If the participant logic is changed then it can be reloaded:
  skynet reload example
