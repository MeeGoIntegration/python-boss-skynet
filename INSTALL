Ensure Rabbit MQ is running

The shipped configuration assumes it is running on localhost and has
the following simple setup:

rabbitmqctl add_vhost boss
rabbitmqctl add_user boss boss
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p boss boss '.*' '.*' '.*'

On the skynet machine we need to setup some code as a participant:
  skynet make_participant -n check -p /usr/share/doc/python-boss-skynet/example-check-participant
  skynet make_participant -n notify -p /usr/share/doc/python-boss-skynet/example-notify-participant

The code for these paricipants is in /usr/share/doc/python-boss-skynet/

Now we need to ensure it runs (and restarts if there's a crash):
  skynet enable check
  skynet enable notify

To watch the log output:
  skynet log check &
  skynet log notify &

Now we need to tell boss that there is something listening on these
queues and available for use in processes:
  skynet register -n check
  skynet register -n notify


Launch a process

With a participant ready to do some work, we're ready to launch a process:
  /usr/share/doc/boss/skynet_launch

Now do:
  echo Hi there > /tmp/success

And relaunch:
  /usr/share/doc/boss/skynet_launch

The process can be launched from anywhere
